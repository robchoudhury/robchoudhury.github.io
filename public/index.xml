&lt;p&gt;Full data and analysis &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robchoudhury/pm_filaree&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publication &lt;a href=&#34;https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/full/10.1094/PDIS-05-15-0527-PDN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;powdery-mildew-on-whitestem-filaree&#34;&gt;Powdery Mildew on Whitestem Filaree&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was walking around my neighborhood in Davis, CA one day when I noticed a strange looking weed on the ground that had powdery mildew on it&amp;rsquo;s surface. Powdery mildews are a group of biotrophic fungi that I had studied for my master&amp;rsquo;s degree. They are often times host specific, and do not regularly kill their host, but rather sap nutrients and water from the epidermal cells. Because powdery mildews are so host specific, and because diseases of weeds are often underreported, I was interested in seeing whether this was a new interaction for California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After running home and grabbing some nitrile gloves and ziplock bags, I collected some samples and headed off for work. I had a close working relationship with Dr. Doug Gubler&amp;rsquo;s lab because I did my master&amp;rsquo;s degree there, so I was able to use their compound microscope to look at the conidia at a higher magnification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/img/img_ucd/SNAP-113923-0006.bmp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conidial-measurements&#34;&gt;Conidial Measurements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conidia of the powdery mildew had some distinct fibrosin bodies (the shiny bits inside the cells) which are kind of diagnostic for species of &lt;em&gt;Podosphaera&lt;/em&gt;. The conidia looked like they were forming in chains, and the shape of the appressoria (how the fungus accesses plant nutrients in the epidermis) looked nipple-shaped. All of these morphological lines of evidence suggested that the fungus was in the genus &lt;em&gt;Podosphaera&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to take measurements of different microscopic portions of the fungus to compare with those of described species, so we measured the length of the conidiophore as well as the length and width of the conidia themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/img/img_ucd/conidiophore_length_filaree_pm.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conidiophore lengths were typical for &lt;em&gt;Podosphaera&lt;/em&gt; spp., and the length to width ratio were as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/img/img_ucd/length_width_ratio_filaree_pm.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;phylogenetic-analysis&#34;&gt;Phylogenetic Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to know how our isolate was phylogenetically related to other isolates within the genus &lt;em&gt;Podosphaera&lt;/em&gt;. This might help us narrow down which species the isolate belongs to, as well as provides the scientific community more broadly a record for the isolate that we had collected. We isolated DNA and amplified for parts of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, a highly variable region flanked by stable sequences, allowing for relatively high-resolution phylogenetic identification of isolates of fungi. We compared our isolates to those of other &lt;em&gt;Podosphaera&lt;/em&gt; species, and found that our isolate was identical to a sequence for a supposed &lt;em&gt;Podosphaera xanthii&lt;/em&gt; that was collected from papaya in asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/img/img_ucd/podosphaera_filaree_phylogeny.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-case-of-mistaken-identity&#34;&gt;A Case of Mistaken Identity?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when we compare the &lt;em&gt;P. xanthii&lt;/em&gt; that most closely matched with our &lt;em&gt;Podosphaera&lt;/em&gt; isolate, we found that the isolate was not monophyletically grouped with other &lt;em&gt;P. xanthii&lt;/em&gt; isolates. This could have occurred if the original identification was incorrect or if the samples or sequences got mixed up while in submission. Both of these things happen more often than I think most scientists would care to admit. Comparing the morphology of our isolate with others in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://my.apsnet.org/ItemDetail?iProductCode=51892&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taxonomic Manual of the Erysiphales (Powdery Mildews)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we found that our isolate most closely resembled &lt;em&gt;Podosphaera erodii&lt;/em&gt;, which had been reported in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because powdery mildew isolates are biotrophic, the only way to conclusively define our isolate as &lt;em&gt;Podosphaera erodii&lt;/em&gt; would be to go to the collections in Europe and examine them. That was far out of the budget that the project had (a whopping $0), so without a complementary confirming sequence, we had to define our species as &lt;em&gt;Podosphaera&lt;/em&gt; cf. &lt;em&gt;erodii&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cf.&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;cf.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; referring to contrasting our isolate with a known isolate where there is uncertainty in taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describing the diversity of life is critical to understanding what we face to lose in the case of extreme habitat loss and climate change. Oftentimes, the death of a single species is not a single death, but rather a cascading event that affects all of the species that rely on that extinct group. Pathogens and parasites are thought to be some of the the largest groups of life, with each species having multiple host-specific pathogens and parasites. As we lose diversity, these groups that may have been useful for biocontrol of weeds or for pharmological purposes are lost as well, and we need to consider how this may have cascading effects throughout the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Colors</title>
      <link>https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/post/colors/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;There has been more and more research on how to better design figures and color schemes to suit a broader audience. Roughly 8% of men and 0.5% of women have some sort of colorblindness, so if I present a figure during an extension or scientific talk, I really need to make sure that the information comes across correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are lots of great packages out there that give options on what color scales I can use. I really wanted to keep track of some of my favorites, and how I created the visualizations, so this is kind of a short guide on that. There are lots of other resources out there, this is something that I kept going back to as a reference, and wanted to make public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-color-scales-are-available&#34;&gt;What Color Scales are Available?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many MANY packages that make color palettes, ( &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/paletteer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;paletteer&lt;/a&gt; seems to be an R resource for many of them), but the classic that my colleagues and I use alot is &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;viridis&lt;/a&gt;, which offers five beautiful palettes. I wanted to compare those five to some others that I found around and thought looked interesting and kind of similar to the viridis five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pals::pal.bands(pals::ocean.thermal, viridis::plasma, viridis::magma,pals::ocean.matter, pals::ocean.oxy, viridis::inferno, viridis::viridis, pals::parula , pals::ocean.haline, viridis::cividis)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/img/img_colors/colors_compare.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the palettes that are available through the pals package seem to be useful, and seem to mimic what we see in viridis. I really like the Parula palette, it reminds me of the old-school Matlab plots, very retro chic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-colorblind-friendly-are-any-of-these-palettes&#34;&gt;How Colorblind-Friendly are Any of these Palettes?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see the different palettes, we really want to know how they will be perceived by those with different forms of colorblindness. Ideally, we would want a color palette that looks like it ramps fairly smoothly over the entire range, and that the ramp looks uniformly smooth across the different colorblindness types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pals::pal.safe(pals::parula)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/img/img_colors/colors_cb_safe.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like the Parula palette is fairly safe and uniform for those with BW/Deutan/Protan blindness, but not as uniform for Tritan. Ideally, we would want a palette that can cover all of them. Check out this great article describing the creation of the cividis color palette &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01662&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and how it is likely one of the more optimal settings for figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-actual-colors&#34;&gt;What are the Actual Colors?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you want to use the hex codes involved in the different palettes. I use the scales function show_col to show the different colors, and here I am using the rcartocolor package palette &amp;lsquo;ag_Sunset&amp;rsquo;, which I find incredibly beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scales::show_col(colorRampPalette(rcartocolor::carto_pal(name = &amp;ldquo;ag_Sunset&amp;rdquo;))(25))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/img/img_colors/ag_sunset.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really and truly just the tip of the iceberg, but with a small amount of care, you can easily modify your scientific figures to be more easily and accurately understood by a fairly large chunk of the populace.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cyclosporiapsis Outbreak in Texas 2017</title>
      <link>https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/post/cyclosporiapsis-outbreak-in-texas-2017/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/post/cyclosporiapsis-outbreak-in-texas-2017/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robchoudhury/TexasCyclospora&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;You can find the code for this post at&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyclosporiasis is an intestinal sickness caused by the coccidian parasite &lt;em&gt;Cyclospora cayetanensis&lt;/em&gt;. An outbreak in 2017 seemingly from Mexican cilantro has affected many people, and the Texas public health board and CDC put out some of the data publically. I wanted to go through this data, make choropleth plots for the counties affected (because I am unfamiliar with Texan counties) and plot out the data. This was also prompted because I ate some cilantro and immediately went into hypochondriac mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-is-the-outbreak-occurring-in-texas&#34;&gt;Where is the Outbreak Occurring in Texas?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/img/img_cyclospora/Aug02.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/img/img_cyclospora/Aug22.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a 20-day period, the several counties in Texas. Things really light up in the counties that countain big cities like Houston, Austin, and Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happened-over-the-course-of-the-epidemic&#34;&gt;What Happened Over the Course of the Epidemic?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/img/img_cyclospora/timeline.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/img/img_cyclospora/totalcases.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the CDC dataset, we can see that things get pretty bad, but start to settle down after mid-July. This may have been due to raised awareness of the outbreak or removal of the affected material from shelves and stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this outbreak highlighted the interconnectedness of agricultural trade, especially with Mexico, and the vulnerability of these systems to even small amounts of distant contamination. Understanding epidemic dynamics and mapping out locations of disease can help to highlight areas that are especially susceptible to problems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Miami Mango Ratings</title>
      <link>https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/post/miami-mango-ratings/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/post/miami-mango-ratings/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robchoudhury/mango_rating&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Full analysis here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mangos are grown widely in South Florida, but only a few varieties ever make it north, because they don’t really ship well and there isn’t a huge market. I ended up receiving some rare varieties from a collaborator down south, and I wanted to know how they ranked one to another, so my wife and I rated the different varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-data&#34;&gt;The Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I rated the mangoes over the course of about a week, tasting the different varieties as they felt more and more ripe. We each did a subjective rating of 1-10, with 1 being &amp;ldquo;this tastes terrible&amp;rdquo;, and 10 being &amp;ldquo;this is literally the best mango I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had&amp;rdquo;. We rated independent of each other, recording our ratings, and I collated the data for this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-they-perform&#34;&gt;How Did They Perform?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/img/img_mango/variety_rating.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So overall, it looks like &lt;em&gt;Kensington Pride&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hayden&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Edwards&lt;/em&gt; were clear winners, and the other varieties were not. What happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the other data in the file (filled with NA&amp;rsquo;s, sorry) there are notes on the stringiness and the taste of the varieties. Poor varieties like &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tart&lt;/em&gt; had chalky texture in the mouth, and would sometimes smell like tylenol, or have no aroma at all. Good performers had very slight to no stringiness, and had the kind of &amp;lsquo;quintessential&amp;rsquo; tastes of mango: fruity, tropical, rich. &lt;em&gt;Kensington Pride&lt;/em&gt; was my favorite, and it tasted a bit like muscadine grapes. Mid-performers like &lt;em&gt;Nam Duk Moi&lt;/em&gt; had stringiness, and &lt;em&gt;Dot&lt;/em&gt; would sometimes have a popcorn like flavor, or tasted too sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did my wife and I have different views on these mangos?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/img/img_mango/person_rating_dumbbell.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had fairly similar ratings, but it looks like I pretty consistently rated things more favorably than she did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in Miami area in July, you NEED to taste mangoes. They grow on street trees, make friends, knock on doors, see if people will sell them to you. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bird Ages</title>
      <link>https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/post/bird-ages/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/post/bird-ages/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bird-age&#34;&gt;Bird Age&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full analysis is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robchoudhury/birdage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stumbled across a dataset of bird ages on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbl/longevity/longevity_main.cfm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;USGS website&lt;/a&gt;, and wanted to know if there was a relationship between bird age and other variables (weight, wingspan, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;link-between-bird-age-and-phylogenetic-order&#34;&gt;Link Between Bird Age and Phylogenetic Order?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know if there was any signal for how old birds get if theyre closely related. Ultimately, I would love to know how age is affected by size (weight, wingspan, whatever) but I cant find open datasets for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/img/img_bird_age/joy_plot.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like some bird orders have individuals that live longer than others, but it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to say for some whether thats just a sampling issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mean-variance-relationship&#34;&gt;Mean Variance Relationship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the mean and the variance of a dataset can tell you &amp;hellip; stuff (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_function&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_function&lt;/a&gt;). Honestly I was just curious if there was a relationship, I need to revisit why this bit is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://robchoudhury.netlify.com/img/img_bird_age/mean_variance.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like there is a pretty strong relationship between log mean and log variance, with an R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of 0.3722, a slope of 0.14848.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-up&#34;&gt;Next Up?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, it would be awesome to find a dataset that tied bird name with bird weight or wingspan or other variables. That way you could see if bird weight/wingspan correlated with age or phylogeny. It would also be cool to see a tree of bird orders to see if more closely related things had similar ages.&lt;/p&gt;
