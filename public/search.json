The Haitian revolution took nearly 15 years and cost countless lives, but resulted in one of the first nations that was slave-free and ruled by non-whites and former captives. The loss of Haiti (then called Saint-Domingue) forced the cash-starved Napoleon to sell the Louisiana territory to the United States, one of the single largest land purchases in our countries history. In the ensuing 200 years, Haiti has struggled; as a country founded by former slaves, they were forced to repay reparations for lost \u0026lsquo;property\u0026rsquo; to France (approximately $21 Billion, according to Wikipedia). And recent comments by a world leader suggests that their struggle are far from over. Despite ALL of this, I (personally) knew nearly next to nothing about Haiti prior to a year ago. While I would periodically hear about tragedies like the 2010 Hatian earthquake and the subsequent cholera epidemic (that the UN only recently took responsibility for), Haiti always remained \u0026hellip; \u0026lsquo;over there\u0026rsquo; in my mind. A place that exists, that I may have learned about, but was never quite close enough for me to think much about.\nLuckily, Garrett Lab and University of Florida are involved in a rather large Feed the Future AREA project focused on improving Haitian agriculture, and I have learned a lot more in the past year. My labmember Dr. Joubert Fayette is a Haitian national who got his PhD here at the UF Plant Pathology department, and is working to help re-build the diagnostic capabilities of Haiti so that they can detect and respond to threats (you can read more about his work with AREA here). Wanita Dantes and James Fulton are graduate students in garrett lab researching an emerging plantain disease in Haiti that causes the trees to topple over just as they are full of fruit. While my work primarily focuses on laurel wilt disease of avocados in Florida, Haiti and Dominican Republic are some of our nearest neighbors, so we wanted to get an initial look at how at-risk their avocado groves are to Laurel Wilt Disease. We wanted to find some production statistics that might help to explain where production occurs in the country and where we should be monitoring for disease. We were also curious about production statistics for other crops: other projects in Garrett lab focus on a disease that alternatively hosts on mango, and sweetpotato seed trade in Uganda (see more of Kelsey Andersen\u0026rsquo;s work here).\nThe Data I found a dataset of a report posted by the Haitian Ministry of Agriculture (see it here (PDF WARNING)). The report is in French, but I took a few years of french in high school and my grandfather and mother speak french, so I was able to piece together enough. The report describes different levels of production of some important crops in Haiti in different Departments (effectively like states). I got map data of the different Departments from (GADM)[https://gadm.org/maps.html], which hosts maps of political boundaries at different levels (country, state, county, town).\nAvocado Production I was primarily concerned about finding out more about avocado production in Haiti. Avocado production in Haiti and the Dominican Republic are important both for local and export markets, as well as for food security. Most of the fruit are West Indian types, which are typically greener, and have a less buttery feel to them than Hass varieties. We grow a ton (~8000 acres) of West Indian varieties, and Dominican Republic is our main market competitors. Many of the varieties that are in Haiti were brought there from California and Florida in the mid-1920\u0026rsquo;s to the Central Experiment Station of the Hatian Dept. of Ag. near Port au Prince.\nThis map shows some fairly heavy production in the Artibonite and Grand-Anse regions as well as in the Nord and Centre Departments. We now need to locate important agricultural ports and run some wind run models to see what is the liklihood of the disease reaching these areas. That is for a future publication\nBanana and Plantain Production We were interested in banana and plantain production because of Toppling disease, and it looks (based on this map) like much of the production is in the Ouest Department. We are currently comparing these data to other published data to see if it matches with what has previously been reported for banana production.\nMango Production Mangos are incredibly delicious (see my previous blogpost if you don\u0026rsquo;t believe me!), and are both nutritionally and economically important for Haiti.\nMost of Haitian mango production is in the Artibonite and Nord Departments.\nSweetpotato Production Sweetpotatoes were the trickiest. The Haitian word, \u0026lsquo;patate\u0026rsquo; sounds VERY close to potato; luckily Joubert corrected my rookie mistake!\nLike many of the other crops here, there is heavy production in Arbonite Department.\nConclusions Haiti is an incredibly resilient country that just needs a little bit of help to make it\u0026rsquo;s agriculture robust and sustainable. I am fortunate to work alongside those involved in the AREA project as they help to rebuild this proud country\u0026rsquo;s capabilities for sustainable agriculture!\n","date":1547424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547424000,"objectID":"1c60112437071d5a35d4c07038bdf2a3","permalink":"https://robchoudhury.com/post/haiti-production/","publishdate":"2019-01-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/haiti-production/","section":"post","summary":"Full analysis here\nHaiti is one of our nation\u0026rsquo;s nearest neighbors, and has been a key player in world history over the past 200 years.

I work on a project researching a disease of avocados (and other plants in the same family, Lauraceae) that causes rapid death, laurel wilt. Avocados in Florida are threatened by laurel wilt. Most production occurs in Miami-Dade county, mostly around the Homestead production region. The avocados grown in Florida tend to be of the West Indian races, whereas Hass are Mexican-Guatamalan hybrid races. West Indian races are larger (think about the size of a grapefruit) and are more watery and floral than Hass. Most of the varieties grown in south Florida are not exported because they don\u0026rsquo;t ship well. I was fortunately to go down and gather some avocados from the University of Florida Tropical Research and Extension Center (UF-TREC), where my collaborator Dr. Jonathan Crane works. I brought them back north to the Garrett lab in Gainesville, where we tasted and rated the avocados as they became ripe.\nHere they are! The Data We rated the avocados over the course of about a week, and I have to be honest, by the end I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to see another avocado again for a long time. Eating one avocado is a joy; eating 10 in a very short time span is a slog. In addition, not all of them were very good! Some were better than others, but most of the reviewers thought that the Hass was probably better than most of these. That said, our palates (palletes? I\u0026rsquo;m still thinking about the last blog post) have been refined to enjoy Hass. If we had grown up with these varieties, we might have had more positive thoughts on them. It took about a week for all of the fruit to ripen, and we ate them as they became ready. We each did a subjective rating of 1-10, with 1 being \u0026ldquo;this tastes terrible\u0026rdquo;, and 10 being \u0026ldquo;this is literally the best avocado I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had / this is as good as Hass\u0026rdquo;. We rated independent of each other, recording our ratings, and I collated the data for this dataset. Not everyone rated all avocados (except for me), but most people rated at least two.\nHow Did They Perform? So overall, it looks like Lara Red, Tonnage, and Pahokee were top of the heap, but the others were all close behind.\nMost of the avocados were rich, but not quite as rich as a typical Hass, which has a nice butteryness and clean mouthfeel. Some of the avocados were watery, which definitely cost them points. Others had distinct off-flavors, kind of vegetative or acrid.\nDid people have different views on the avocados? YES! Overall, some people were quite positive about some varieties and negative about others. However, most people had similar ratings across the board, with only a few people with distinct opinions on the avocados. Kelsey and I rated the most avocados over the period, so ours tended to be the most negative. I was curious if there was a relationship between the number of avocados that we rated and the mean avocado rating we had, so I did a simple linear regression of the two.\nThere was a decent relationship between the two, with an R^2 of 0.4447 and a p value of 0.0297. It seems that for every additional avocado a person rated, their mean rating score dropped by about 0.2, which is noticable.\nWas there an effect of time? YES! It looks like as the week wore on, people got more and more tired of avocados. While the first few varieties garnered wide support, the later varieties were not as popular. However, its difficult to disentangle the effect of rating date with variety itself, as we did not taste the varieties all on the same day, but rather on sequential days.\nDid Raters Group Together? I have been looking into community analyses, and I wanted to know whether the ratings performed by each person could help to group the raters into \u0026lsquo;camps\u0026rsquo;. I used the \u0026lsquo;decorana\u0026rsquo; function within the \u0026lsquo;vegan\u0026rsquo; package to conduct a detrended correspondance analysis. I had to fill in the gaps for how people rated, and I filled them in with zeros, which probably screwed up the data and analysis somewhat. It looks like Ricardo and I rated things similarly, and Kelsey and Yanru rated their similarly, but overall there was quite a bit of differentiation among raters.\nConclusions If you are in the Miami or Homestead area, try to get your hands on some of the local varieties. They weren\u0026rsquo;t all winners, but it was really interesting to taste the West Indian types and see how they all compare with one another.\n","date":1542672000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542672000,"objectID":"ef6d0e1662e95a8f09dad6a2c74297ed","permalink":"https://robchoudhury.com/post/avocado-ratings/","publishdate":"2018-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/avocado-ratings/","section":"post","summary":"Full analysis here\nGlobal avocado production mostly focuses in Mexico, with the most prominent variety being \u0026lsquo;Hass\u0026rsquo;.

Powdery mildews are a group of biotrophic fungi that I had studied for my master\u0026rsquo;s degree. They are often times host specific, and do not regularly kill their host, but rather sap nutrients and water from the epidermal cells. Because powdery mildews are so host specific, and because diseases of weeds are often underreported, I was interested in seeing whether this was a new interaction for California.\nAfter running home and grabbing some nitrile gloves and ziplock bags, I collected some samples and headed off for work. I had a close working relationship with Dr. Doug Gubler\u0026rsquo;s lab because I did my master\u0026rsquo;s degree there, so I was able to use their compound microscope to look at the conidia at a higher magnification.\nConidial Measurements The conidia of the powdery mildew had some distinct fibrosin bodies (the shiny bits inside the cells) which are kind of diagnostic for species of Podosphaera. The conidia looked like they were forming in chains, and the shape of the appressoria (how the fungus accesses plant nutrients in the epidermis) looked nipple-shaped. All of these morphological lines of evidence suggested that the fungus was in the genus Podosphaera.\nWe wanted to take measurements of different microscopic portions of the fungus to compare with those of described species, so we measured the length of the conidiophore as well as the length and width of the conidia themselves.\nThe conidiophore lengths were typical for Podosphaera spp., and the length to width ratio were as well.\nPhylogenetic Analysis We wanted to know how our isolate was phylogenetically related to other isolates within the genus Podosphaera. This might help us narrow down which species the isolate belongs to, as well as provides the scientific community more broadly a record for the isolate that we had collected. We isolated DNA and amplified for parts of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, a highly variable region flanked by stable sequences, allowing for relatively high-resolution phylogenetic identification of isolates of fungi. We compared our isolates to those of other Podosphaera species, and found that our isolate was identical to a sequence for a supposed Podosphaera xanthii that was collected from papaya in asia.\nA Case of Mistaken Identity? However, when we compare the P. xanthii that most closely matched with our Podosphaera isolate, we found that the isolate was not monophyletically grouped with other P. xanthii isolates. This could have occurred if the original identification was incorrect or if the samples or sequences got mixed up while in submission. Both of these things happen more often than I think most scientists would care to admit. Comparing the morphology of our isolate with others in the Taxonomic Manual of the Erysiphales (Powdery Mildews), we found that our isolate most closely resembled Podosphaera erodii, which had been reported in Europe.\nBecause powdery mildew isolates are biotrophic, the only way to conclusively define our isolate as Podosphaera erodii would be to go to the collections in Europe and examine them. That was far out of the budget that the project had (a whopping $0), so without a complementary confirming sequence, we had to define our species as Podosphaera cf. erodii, the \u0026lsquo;cf.\u0026rsquo; referring to contrasting our isolate with a known isolate where there is uncertainty in taxonomy.\nConclusions Describing the diversity of life is critical to understanding what we face to lose in the case of extreme habitat loss and climate change. Oftentimes, the death of a single species is not a single death, but rather a cascading event that affects all of the species that rely on that extinct group. Pathogens and parasites are thought to be some of the the largest groups of life, with each species having multiple host-specific pathogens and parasites. As we lose diversity, these groups that may have been useful for biocontrol of weeds or for pharmological purposes are lost as well, and we need to consider how this may have cascading effects throughout the landscape.\n","date":1540857600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540857600,"objectID":"ebcdad9e2b471587a7126a3d75d9c65a","permalink":"https://robchoudhury.com/post/pm-filaree/","publishdate":"2018-10-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/pm-filaree/","section":"post","summary":"Full data and analysis here\nPublication here\nPowdery Mildew on Whitestem Filaree I was walking around my neighborhood in Davis, CA one day when I noticed a strange looking weed on the ground that had powdery mildew on it\u0026rsquo;s surface.

I really wanted to keep track of some of my favorites, and how I created the visualizations, so this is kind of a short guide on that. There are lots of other resources out there, this is something that I kept going back to as a reference, and wanted to make public.\nWhat Color Scales are Available? There are many MANY packages that make color palettes, ( paletteer seems to be an R resource for many of them), but the classic that my colleagues and I use alot is viridis, which offers five beautiful palettes. I wanted to compare those five to some others that I found around and thought looked interesting and kind of similar to the viridis five.\n pals::pal.bands(pals::ocean.thermal, viridis::plasma, viridis::magma,pals::ocean.matter, pals::ocean.oxy, viridis::inferno, viridis::viridis, pals::parula , pals::ocean.haline, viridis::cividis)\n So the palettes that are available through the pals package seem to be useful, and seem to mimic what we see in viridis. I really like the Parula palette, it reminds me of the old-school Matlab plots, very retro chic.\nHow Colorblind-Friendly are Any of these Palettes? As much as it\u0026rsquo;s interesting to see the different palettes, we really want to know how they will be perceived by those with different forms of colorblindness. Ideally, we would want a color palette that looks like it ramps fairly smoothly over the entire range, and that the ramp looks uniformly smooth across the different colorblindness types.\n pals::pal.safe(pals::parula)\n It looks like the Parula palette is fairly safe and uniform for those with BW/Deutan/Protan blindness, but not as uniform for Tritan. Ideally, we would want a palette that can cover all of them. Check out this great article describing the creation of the cividis color palette here, and how it is likely one of the more optimal settings for figures.\nWhat are the Actual Colors? Sometimes you want to use the hex codes involved in the different palettes. I use the scales function show_col to show the different colors, and here I am using the rcartocolor package palette \u0026lsquo;ag_Sunset\u0026rsquo;, which I find incredibly beautiful.\n scales::show_col(colorRampPalette(rcartocolor::carto_pal(name = \u0026ldquo;ag_Sunset\u0026rdquo;))(25))\n Conclusions?

However, climate change is likely to alter the geographic ranges and impacts for a variety of insect pests, plant pathogens, and weeds, and the consequences for managed systems, particularly agriculture, remain uncertain. That uncertainty is related, in part, to whether pest management practices (e.g., biological, chemical, cultural, etc.) can adapt to climate/CO2 induced changes in pest biology to minimize potential loss. The ongoing and projected changes in CO2, environment, managed plant systems, and pest interactions, necessitates an assessment of current management practices and, if warranted, development of viable alternative strategies to counter damage from invasive alien species and evolving native pest populations. We provide an overview of the interactions regarding pest biology and climate/CO2; assess these interactions currently using coffee as a case study; identify the potential vulnerabilities regarding future pest impacts; and discuss possible adaptive strategies, including early detection and rapid response via EDDMapS (Early Detection \u0026 Distribution Mapping System), and integrated pest management (IPM), as adaptive means to improve monitoring pest movements and minimizing biotic losses while improving the efficacy of pest control.","tags":["biology","agriculture","cartography"],"title":"Climate change, carbon dioxide, and pest biology, managing the future: coffee as a case study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["K.

Downy mildews appear to be polyphyletic, with graminicolous downy mildews (GDM), brassicolous downy mildews (BDM) and downy mildews with colored conidia (DMCC) forming a clade with the previously unplaced *Phytophthora taxon totara*; downy mildews with pyriform haustoria (DMPH) were placed in their own clade with affinities to the obligate biotrophic P. cyperi.

Trees containing all twenty extant downy mildew genera were produced by adding partial coverage of seventeen additional downy mildew taxa; these trees supported the monophyly of the BDMs, DMCCs and DMPHs but suggested that the GDMs are paraphyletic in respect to the BDMs or polyphyletic. Incongruence between nuclear-only and mitochondrial-only trees suggests introgression may have occurred between several clades, particularly those containing biotrophs, questioning whether obligate biotrophic parasitism and other traits with polyphyletic distributions arose independently or were horizontally transferred.

Quarantine programs help reduce the introduction of exotic pathogens into a country, but few regulations directly apply to reducing the re-introduction and spread of endemic pathogens.  Use of phytosanitary thresholds helps limit the movement of pathogen inoculum through seed, but the costs associated with rejected seed lots can be prohibitive for voluntary implementation of phytosanitary thresholds.  In this paper, we outline a framework to optimize thresholds for seedborne pathogens, balancing the cost of rejected seed lots and benefit of reduced inoculum levels.  The method requires relatively small amounts of data, and the accuracy and robustness of the analysis improves over time as data accumulate from seed testing.  We demonstrate the method first and illustrate it with a case study of seedborne oospores of *Peronospora effusa*, the causal agent of spinach downy mildew.  A seed lot threshold of 0.23 oospores per seed could reduce the overall number of oospores entering the production system by 90% while removing 8% of seed lots destined for distribution.  Alternative mitigation strategies may result in lower economic losses to seed producers, but have uncertain efficacy.

The beetle is the primary vector of *R. lauricola* in forests along the southeastern coastal plain of the United States, but other ambrosia beetle species that obtained the pathogen after the initial introduction may play a role in the avocado (*Persea americana* Miller) pathosystem. Susceptible taxa are naïve (new-encounter) hosts that originated outside Asia. In the southeastern United States, over 300 million trees of redbay (*P. borbonia* (L.) Spreng.) have been lost, and other North American endemics, non-Asian ornamentals and avocado—an important crop that originated in MesoAmerica—are also affected. However, there are no reports of laurel wilt on the significant number of lauraceous endemics that occur in the Asian homeland of *R. lauricola* and *X. glabratus*; coevolved resistance to the disease in the region has been hypothesized. The rapid spread of laurel wilt in the United States is due to an efficient vector, *X. glabratus*, and the movement of wood infested with the insect and pathogen. These factors, the absence of fully resistant genotypes, and the paucity of effective control measures severely constrain the disease’s management in forest ecosystems and avocado production areas.","tags":["mycology","biology","epidemiology","agriculture"],"title":"Laurel wilt in natural and agricultural ecosystems: understanding the drivers and scales of complex pathosystems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

It has since become an invasive species in the Southeastern US, displacing native species in wetland prairies and bottomland forests. In California, the tree is planted as an ornamental, and is often used as a street tree because of its shallow roots and colorful foliage. In June 2014, colonies of a powdery mildew species were observed on leaves and stems of Chinese tallow trees in Davis, California. Colonies were diffuse and appeared on both the abaxial and adaxial surface of younger leaves. Heavily affected leaves appeared distorted and chlorotic. Microscopic observation revealed ectophytic hyaline mycelia with catenulate spores. Conidia measured 25 to 42.5 x 10 to 17.5 um (n=55), with an average length to width ratio of 2.9, and had fibrosin bodies. Conidiophores measured 65 to 112.5 x 7.5 to 12.5 um (n=15). Conidia had lateral to sub-terminal germination and formed a short, unbranched germ tube approximately the same length as the conidia. Hyphal appressoria appeared as slightly nipple-shaped when formed on leaves. No chasmothecia were observed on infected leaves. Detached leaves from unaffected plants were gathered. Leaves were washed in 0.6% sodium hypochlorite solution for one minute, followed by a triple wash with distilled water for 30 seconds each. Ten leaves were artificially infected by gently rubbing infected leaves onto the wet leaf surface of detached leaves. Ten non-inoculated detached leaves were used as a control. The trial was repeated twice. All infected leaves showed signs of powdery mildew growth after 7 days, and control plants remained symptomless. The fungus present on the inoculated leaves was identical morphologically to that initially observed on diseased plants, fulfilling Koch's postulates.

Low levels of *P. effusa* DNA were detectable from December through February in both winters but increased during January in both years, in correlation with observed disease incidence; sharp peaks in *P. effusa* DNA detection were associated with the onset of disease incidence. The incidence of downy mildew in the susceptible field displayed logistic-like dynamics but with considerable interseason variation. Analysis of the area under the disease progress curves suggested that the 2013-14 epidemic was significantly more severe than the 2014-15 epidemic. Spatial analyses indicated that disease incidence was dependent within an average range of 5.6 m, approximately equivalent to the width of three planted beds in a typical production field. The spatial distribution of spores captured during an active epidemic most closely fit a power-law distribution but could also be fit with an exponential distribution. These studies revealed two important results in the epidemiology of spinach downy mildew in California. First, they demonstrated the potential of impaction spore-trap samplers linked with a qPCR assay for indicating periods of high disease risk, as well as the detection of long-distance dispersal of *P. effusa* spores. Second, at the scale of individual crops, a high degree of spatial aggregation in disease incidence was revealed.","tags":["mycology","biology","epidemiology","agriculture"],"title":"Spatiotemporal patterns in the airborne dispersal of spinach downy mildew","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

In February of 2015, many plants growing along a roadside in Yolo County, California were found to be severely infected with a powdery mildew. Leaves appeared lightly chlorotic with reddened tips, and showed distinct patches of abundant hyphal growth on both sides of the leaves, stem, and fruit. Conidia were hyaline, ellipsoid to barrel-shaped, measured 24 to 29 x 16 to 24 um (n = 50), with an average length/width ratio of 1.6, and had distinct fibrosin bodies. Conidiophores measured 90 to 130 um (n = 15) in length and produced 2 to 5 catenescent conidia. Foot cells were cylindrical and measured 45 to 66 x 6 to 7.5 um (n = 20). Conidia had lateral to subterminal germination and formed a short, unbranched germ tube approximately the same length as the conidia. Hyphal appressoria appeared as slightly nipple-shaped when formed on leaves. No chasmothecia were observed on any of the field-infected tissue. These morphological features were consistent with *Podosphaera erodii* (Braun and Cook 2012). Leaves from healthy field-grown *E. moschatum* plants were collected, surface-disinfested with 0.4% sodium hypochlorite, rinsed twice in deionized water, and suspended in 1.5% water agar. Ten leaves were inoculated by gently pressing a diseased leaf onto the surface of the healthy leaves. Ten noninoculated leaves served as a control treatment. Leaves were maintained in a laboratory at 22 +/- 2C. Inoculated leaves developed symptoms and signs after 7 days, whereas the control plants remained symptomless. The fungus present on the inoculated leaves was identical morphologically to that initially observed on diseased plants, fulfilling Koch's postulates. The pathogenicity test was performed twice.

DNA sequences from three California isolates were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers KC937062, KC937065, KF481957, KF481598, KF481959, and KF481960. Pathogenicity tests were performed in March 2011 on 3-year-old Bartlett pear trees planted at an experimental farm in Davis, CA. A single, circular, 2-cm pruning wound at the top of the trunk was inoculated on each of three single-tree replications using 2-cm mycelial plugs from 14-day-old colonies growing on PDA. After inoculation, mycelial plugs were covered and sealed with Parafilm and aluminum foil for the duration of the trial. Three control trees were inoculated using sterile PDA plugs. Twelve months after inoculation, UCD103 and UCD105 were consistently re-isolated from the margin between necrotic and healthy tissue using the same methods described for the original isolation, and UCD102 was re-isolated in two out of three plants. The average lesion lengths of UCD102, UCD103, UCD105, and control plants were 12.5, 17.3, 23, and 1 mm, respectively. Control lesions were short and sterile, and seemed to be a physiological reaction from the plant. A second pathogenicity test was completed in 5 months beginning in June 2012. UCD105 was consistently re-isolated, and UCD102 and UCD103 were re-isolated in two out of three plants. The average lesion lengths for UCD102, UCD103, UCD105, and control plants were 2, 3, 5, and 1 mm, respectively. Compared to grapevine (Vitis vinifera), the pathogen grows more slowly in pear tissue under natural conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing D. seriata as a causal agent of pear branch canker in California. Canker diseases can reduce the lifespan of perennial plants, ultimately leading to long term economic losses for growers (3).","tags":["mycology","biology","epidemiology","agriculture"],"title":"First report of Diplodia seriata causing pear branch canker dieback in California","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

Despite its global impact on grape production, *E. necator* is sensitive to adverse environmental conditions, such as excess heat, free water and UV radiation. Using detached leaf co-culture assays, 3-d-old single colonies of E. necator were exposed to 1, 2 or 3 consecutive d of punctuated heat stress. While there was a consistent decrease in colony growth after a single heating event, there were little to no significant effects from subsequent heating events. Similar effects were observed on the latent period of the pathogen, with a large initial effect from the first heat treatment and small marginal effects from subsequent heat treatments. *Erysiphe necator* colonies growing on live pot-grown plants were affected similarly by consecutive heat stress events. These data suggest that *E. necator* is more adaptable to environmental stress than previously recognized.","tags":["mycology","biology","epidemiology"],"title":"Effects of punctuated heat stress on the grapevine powdery mildew pathogen, Erysiphe necator","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rAmanita Birthday Card Painting\r\r\r\r\r\r\rcode{white-space: pre;}\rpre:not([class]) {\rbackground-color: white;\r}\r\rif (window.hljs) {\rhljs.configure({languages: []});\rhljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();\rif (document.readyState \u0026\u0026 document.readyState === \"complete\") {\rwindow.setTimeout(function() { hljs.initHighlighting(); }, 0);\r}\r}\r\rh1 {\rfont-size: 34px;\r}\rh1.title {\rfont-size: 38px;\r}\rh2 {\rfont-size: 30px;\r}\rh3 {\rfont-size: 24px;\r}\rh4 {\rfont-size: 18px;\r}\rh5 {\rfont-size: 16px;\r}\rh6 {\rfont-size: 12px;\r}\r.table th:not([align]) {\rtext-align: left;\r}\r\r\r\r.main-container {\rmax-width: 940px;\rmargin-left: auto;\rmargin-right: auto;\r}\rcode {\rcolor: inherit;\rbackground-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\r}\rimg {\rmax-width:100%;\rheight: auto;\r}\r.tabbed-pane {\rpadding-top: 12px;\r}\r.html-widget {\rmargin-bottom: 20px;\r}\rbutton.code-folding-btn:focus {\routline: none;\r}\rsummary {\rdisplay: list-item;\r}\r\r.tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs {\rdisplay: inline-table;\rmax-height: 500px;\rmin-height: 44px;\roverflow-y: auto;\rbackground: white;\rborder: 1px solid #ddd;\rborder-radius: 4px;\r}\r.tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs  li.active:before {\rcontent: \"\";\rfont-family: 'Glyphicons Halflings';\rdisplay: inline-block;\rpadding: 10px;\rborder-right: 1px solid #ddd;\r}\r.tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs.nav-tabs-open  li.active:before {\rcontent: \"\";\rborder: none;\r}\r.tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs.nav-tabs-open:before {\rcontent: \"\";\rfont-family: 'Glyphicons Halflings';\rdisplay: inline-block;\rpadding: 10px;\rborder-right: 1px solid #ddd;\r}\r.tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs  li.active {\rdisplay: block;\r}\r.tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs  li  a,\r.tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs  li  a:focus,\r.tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs  li  a:hover {\rborder: none;\rdisplay: inline-block;\rborder-radius: 4px;\r}\r.tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs.nav-tabs-open  li {\rdisplay: block;\rfloat: none;\r}\r.tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs  li {\rdisplay: none;\r}\r\r\r$(document).ready(function () {\rwindow.buildTabsets(\"TOC\");\r});\r$(document).ready(function () {\r$('.tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs  li').click(function () {\r$(this).parent().toggleClass('nav-tabs-open')\r});\r});\r\rAmanita Birthday Card Painting\rRobin Choudhury\r2019-03-17\r\rI’m lucky to have some great sisters, so I drew an Amanita and painted it with watercolors and a sharpie pen as a birthday card for her!\n\r\r// add bootstrap table styles to pandoc tables\rfunction bootstrapStylePandocTables() {\r$('tr.header').parent('thead').parent('table').addClass('table table-condensed');\r}\r$(document).ready(function () {\rbootstrapStylePandocTables();\r});\r\r\r(function () {\rvar script = document.createElement(\"script\");\rscript.type = \"text/javascript\";\rscript.src = \"https://mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML\";\rdocument.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(script);\r})();\r\r\r\r","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"410e875006a4fc7161f488973b9d3ec9","permalink":"https://robchoudhury.com/art/2019-03-17_amanita/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/art/2019-03-17_amanita/","section":"art","summary":"Amanita Birthday Card Painting\r\r\r\r\r\r\rcode{white-space: pre;}\rpre:not([class]) {\rbackground-color: white;\r}\r\rif (window.hljs) {\rhljs.configure({languages: []});\rhljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();\rif (document.readyState \u0026\u0026 document.readyState === \"complete\") {\rwindow.setTimeout(function() { hljs.initHighlighting(); }, 0);\r}\r}\r\rh1 {\rfont-size: 34px;\r}\rh1.title {\rfont-size: 38px;\r}\rh2 {\rfont-size: 30px;\r}\rh3 {\rfont-size: 24px;\r}\rh4 {\rfont-size: 18px;\r}\rh5 {\rfont-size: 16px;\r}\rh6 {\rfont-size: 12px;\r}\r.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"art"}]
