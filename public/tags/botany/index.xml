      <description>I have three awesome sisters, so this was the painting I made for my sister Mimi&amp;rsquo;s birthday card. I&amp;rsquo;m lucky that my work is close by to some really cool gardens on campus, including the Ficke Garden just north of the Microbiology Building.
I put this art up on my redbubble account (https://www.redbubble.com/people/robchoudhury) so that I could buy it in sticker format</description>

      <description>I have three awesome sisters, so this was the painting I made for my sister Abby&amp;rsquo;s birthday card. Florida lights up with tons of azaleas every spring, and my house is surrounded by them, so I wanted her to get a glimpse of some while they were in season.
