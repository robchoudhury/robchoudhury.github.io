      <title>Spinach Downy Mildew Biofungicide Trials</title>

Published in Plant Disease Management Reports 2014, 2015, and 2016.
Throughout my PhD work, it became obvious that the challenges of spinach downy mildew were most heavily impacting organic growers. They were unable to rely on conventional synthetic pesticides that were able to suitably control disease in the conventional crop, and had to rely on resistance to control the disease. I wanted to see if any biofungicide had effect on the disease.</description>

      <title>Climate Change Book Chapter</title>

      <description>I was part of an upcoming book chapter on the threat of climate change for pathogens, and all I could think of was the idea of pathogens on the horizon. I painted a watercolor illustration for the book chapter, maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll be used as the book cover! The painting draws inspiration from Outrun/vaporwave sort of art that became popular in the late 2010&amp;rsquo;s, although the color palette is wayyyy off, it should be neon blue and pink!</description>

      <description>Full analysis is here
Published in Plant Disease Management Reports 2011, and 2012.
During my master&amp;rsquo;s degree, we set out a lot of projects (I had originally intended for my master&amp;rsquo;s to be a PhD&amp;hellip;but thats a story for another time). So I ended up having a ton of different interconnected projects running with Doug Gubler looking at different aspects of grape powdery mildew biology and epidemiology. While we knew that there were differences in how grape varieties and cultivars reacted to powdery mildew, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a great resource that looked at the cultivars grown in California in the present.</description>
