      <description>I was part of an upcoming book chapter on the threat of climate change for pathogens, and all I could think of was the idea of pathogens on the horizon. I painted a watercolor illustration for the book chapter, maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll be used as the book cover! The painting draws inspiration from Outrun/vaporwave sort of art that became popular in the late 2010&amp;rsquo;s, although the color palette is wayyyy off, it should be neon blue and pink!</description>
