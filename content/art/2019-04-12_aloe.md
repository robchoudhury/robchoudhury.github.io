I have three awesome sisters, so this was the painting I made for my sister Mimi's birthday card. I'm lucky that my work is close by to some really cool gardens on campus, including the [Ficke Garden](https://goo.gl/maps/K8ztnjDdG4VE2oYh9) just north of the Microbiology Building.   
I put this art up on my redbubble account (https://www.redbubble.com/people/robchoudhury) so that I could buy it in sticker format
