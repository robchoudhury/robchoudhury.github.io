My former advisor [Neil McRoberts](https://qbelab.plantpathology.ucdavis.edu/neil-mcroberts/) gave a seminar at the UF Plant Pathology department about his work on managing the citrus HLB outbreak in California. They have currently found about 1000 trees in the LA basin with HLB, and the program spends about $40m each year, which he has to fight tooth and nail to get. The disease could devestate California's citrus market, so managing it early is critical.
