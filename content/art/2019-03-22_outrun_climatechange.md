I was part of an upcoming book chapter on the threat of climate change for pathogens, and all I could think of was the idea of pathogens on the horizon. 
I painted a watercolor illustration for the book chapter, maybe it'll be used as the book cover!
The painting draws inspiration from Outrun/vaporwave sort of art that became popular in the late 2010's, although the color palette is wayyyy off, it should be neon blue and pink!
I put this art up on my redbubble account (https://www.redbubble.com/people/robchoudhury) so that I could buy it in sticker format
