abstract = "Spinach downy mildew, caused by the biotrophic oomycete *Peronospora effusa*, is an economically important disease that is found in all spinach growing regions of the US. To effectively predict disease risk we need to understand the response of *P. effusa* to different environmental conditions. We conducted several germination assays, exposing *P. effusa* sporangia to different temperature and lighting conditions. Between 5 and 25C under constant darkness, germination of *P. effusa* sporangia on water agar declined. These results were qualitatively different from a previous study of *P. effusa* germination that found a bimodal response curve, with increased germination at lower and higher temperatures. Time course studies revealed that sporangia consistently germinated within the first twelve hours of plating, regardless of incubation temperature. Sporangia exposed to blue light had significantly reduced germination when compared with those exposed to red, yellow, or no light. Light intensity and color significantly impacted germination, although the effect of color varied by light intensity."
abstract_short="One way to build a disease prediction system is to break down a pathogen's life cycle stages (like germination, growth, and sporulation) and see how the environment affect different components. Then you can reconstruct a mechanistic model that simulates how individual stages impact disease progress given weather in the field. We looked at how environmental variables like temperature and light might impact how the pathogen that causes spinach downy mildew germinates in an effort to gather this initial necessary data."
