abstract = "Phylogenetic relationships between thirteen species of downy mildew and 103 species of *Phytophthora* (plant-pathogenic oomycetes) were investigated with two nuclear and four mitochondrial loci, using several likelihood-based approaches. Three *Phytophthora* taxa and all downy mildew taxa were excluded from the previously recognized subgeneric clades of *Phytophthora*, though all were strongly supported within the paraphyletic genus. Downy mildews appear to be polyphyletic, with graminicolous downy mildews (GDM), brassicolous downy mildews (BDM) and downy mildews with colored conidia (DMCC) forming a clade with the previously unplaced *Phytophthora taxon totara*; downy mildews with pyriform haustoria (DMPH) were placed in their own clade with affinities to the obligate biotrophic P. cyperi. Results suggest the recognition of four additional clades within *Phytophthora*, but few relationships between clades could be resolved. Trees containing all twenty extant downy mildew genera were produced by adding partial coverage of seventeen additional downy mildew taxa; these trees supported the monophyly of the BDMs, DMCCs and DMPHs but suggested that the GDMs are paraphyletic in respect to the BDMs or polyphyletic. Incongruence between nuclear-only and mitochondrial-only trees suggests introgression may have occurred between several clades, particularly those containing biotrophs, questioning whether obligate biotrophic parasitism and other traits with polyphyletic distributions arose independently or were horizontally transferred. Phylogenetic approaches may be limited in their ability to resolve some of the complex relationships between the 'subgeneric' clades of Phytophthora, which include twenty downy mildew genera and hundreds of species."
abstract_short="The phylogenetic relationship between downy mildews and Phytophthoras has always been kind of cryptic. Are they all in the same genus? Closely related genera? Tyler and I deeply wanted these questions answered. He loves Phytophthora, and was entangled in a project to figure out how different forest pathogens were related, and I wanted to know how downy mildews tied in to this important group. We were able to wrangle up some samples and DNA from various downy mildews from all over California, and figured out that 1) the downy mildews are polyphyletic (they arose multiple times, 2) all nested within the 'genus' Phytophthora, and 3) that there seems to be differences between the mitochondrial phylogeny and nuclear phylogeny, suggesting there might be some horizontal mitochondrial movement between clades."
