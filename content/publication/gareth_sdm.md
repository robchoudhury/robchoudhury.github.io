abstract = "For an ordinary least squares regression model, the coefficient of determination R<sup>2</sup> describes the proportion (or percentage) of variance of the response variable explained by the model, and is a widely-accepted summary measure of predictive power. A number of R<sup>2</sup>-analogues are available as summary measures of predictive power for logistic regression models, including models of disease risk. Tjur’s R<sup>2</sup> and McFadden’s R<sup>2</sup> are of particular interest in this context. Both these R<sup>2</sup>-analogues have transparent derivations, which reveal that they apply to different aspects of model evaluation: Tjur’s R<sup>2</sup> is a measure of separation between (known) actual states (e.g., gold standard determinations of “healthy” or “diseased” status) whereas McFadden’s R<sup>2</sup> is a measure of separation between predicted states (e.g., forecasts of disease status based on models of disease risk). This clarifies their interpretation in the context of evaluation of logistic regression models of disease risk. In addition, versions of both Tjur’s R<sup>2</sup> and McFadden’s R<sup>2</sup> may be obtained from analyses of disease risk that are not preceded by logistic regression analysis.Tjur’s R<sup>2</sup> and McFadden’s R<sup>2</sup> are shown to be useful, distinct summary measures of predictive power for epidemiological models of disease risk."
abstract_short="Many people use R<sup>2</sup> summary statistics for ordinary linear regression analyses. However, you can't use the regular types of R<sup>2</sup> methods for non-linear regressions, like those that you would use for logistic regression. There are several different R<sup>2</sup>-analogues out there, but they all do different things and can be useful in different ways. In this paper, we used spore trap data from my PhD thesis to understand how two different metrics work, and what they can tell us about the data. This paper is the culmination of a workshop that Neil and I held at ICPP in 2018; you can find the material for that workshop at https://robchoudhury.github.io/InformationTheory/index.html ."
