# Biography

I am currently a post doctoral researcher in the [Plant Pathology Department](http://plantpath.ifas.ufl.edu/), [Institute for Sustainable Food Systems](http://isfs.institute.ifas.ufl.edu/), and the [Emerging Pathogens Institute](http://www.epi.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida working with [Dr. Karen Garrett](http://www.garrettlab.com/). I am interested in the ecology of emerging pathogens, understanding how they disrupt native systems and propagate. I am currently researching the epidemiology of laurel wilt disease, an invasive beetle-vectored disease that has destroyed both native and agricultural hosts. I use network analysis to model how human behavior at local and regional scales will affect the outcome of the disease progress.

Prior to joining the [Garrett Lab](http://www.garrettlab.com/) at UF, I was a graduate student with [Dr. Neil McRoberts](http://qbelab.plantpathology.ucdavis.edu/) at UC Davis, where I studied the epidemiology and control of spinach downy mildew in coastal California. Before working with Neil, I worked on my master's degree with [Dr. Doug Gubler](https://www.apsnet.org/members/awards/Fellows/Pages/WalterDouglasGubler.aspx) studying grapevine powdery mildew epidemiology. My bachelor's degree is in Plant Sciences from University of Maryland.
