# Biography
I am currently an assistant professor at the [University of Texas Rio Grande Valley](https://www.utrgv.edu/en-us/), where I started in September of 2019. My lab focuses on fungal pathogens that impact crops, and strategies to improve sustainable agriculture, such as biological control strategies. I am also interested in the ecology of emerging pathogens across landscapes, understanding how they disrupt native and agricultural systems, and how climatic factors impact their severity. The Rio Grande Valley is a rich and diverse area, and a critical point for trade between the United States and Mexico (our third largest trading partner). Please contact me if you are interested in joining my lab!

Prior to joining UTRGV, 

I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Plant Pathology Department](http://plantpath.ifas.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida working with [Dr. Karen Garrett](http://www.garrettlab.com/).  I researched the epidemiology of laurel wilt disease, an invasive beetle-vectored disease that has destroyed both native and agricultural hosts using network analyses to model how human behavior at local and regional scales will affect the outcome of the disease progress. Prior to my time at UF, I was a graduate student with [Dr. Neil McRoberts](http://qbelab.plantpathology.ucdavis.edu/) at UC Davis, where I studied the epidemiology and control of spinach downy mildew in coastal California. Before working with Neil, I worked on my master's degree with [Dr. Doug Gubler](https://www.apsnet.org/members/give-awards/awards/Fellows/Pages/WalterDouglasGubler.aspx) studying grapevine powdery mildew epidemiology. My bachelor's degree is in Plant Sciences from University of Maryland.
