Global avocado production mostly focuses in Mexico, with the most prominent variety being 'Hass'. I work on a project researching a disease of avocados (and other plants in the same family, Lauraceae) that causes rapid death, laurel wilt. Avocados in Florida are threatened by laurel wilt. Most production occurs in Miami-Dade county, mostly around the Homestead production region. The avocados grown in Florida tend to be of the West Indian races, whereas Hass are Mexican-Guatamalan hybrid races. West Indian races are larger (think about the size of a grapefruit) and are more watery and floral than Hass. Most of the varieties grown in south Florida are not exported because they don't ship well. I was fortunately to go down and gather some avocados from the University of Florida Tropical Research and Extension Center (UF-TREC), where my collaborator [Dr. Jonathan Crane](https://trec.ifas.ufl.edu/faculty/jcrane/) works. I brought them back north to the [Garrett lab in Gainesville](http://www.garrettlab.com/), where we tasted and rated the avocados as they became ripe.
