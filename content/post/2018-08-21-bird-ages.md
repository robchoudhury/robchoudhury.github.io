## Bird Age

Full analysis [here](https://github.com/robchoudhury/birdage)

I stumbled across a dataset of bird ages on a [USGS website](https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbl/longevity/longevity_main.cfm), and wanted to know if there was a relationship between bird age and other variables (weight, wingspan, etc).

## Link Between Bird Age and Phylogenetic Order?

I wanted to know if there was any signal for how old birds get if theyre closely related. Ultimately, I would love to know how age is affected by size (weight, wingspan, whatever) but I cant find open datasets for that.

Looks like some bird orders have individuals that live longer than others, but it's difficult to say for some whether thats just a sampling issue.

## Mean Variance Relationship

The relationship between the mean and the variance of a dataset can tell you ... stuff (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_function). Honestly I was just curious if there was a relationship, I need to revisit why this bit is important.

It looks like there is a pretty strong relationship between log mean and log variance, with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.3722, a slope of 0.14848. 

## Next Up?

Ideally, it would be awesome to find a dataset that tied bird name with bird weight or wingspan or other variables. That way you could see if bird weight/wingspan correlated with age or phylogeny. It would also be cool to see a tree of bird orders to see if more closely related things had similar ages.
